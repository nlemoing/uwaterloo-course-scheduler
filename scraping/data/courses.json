Incorporation of technical, ecological, social, political, and economic issues in the solution for the project will be required. A basic requirement of the proposed solution is that it must be compatible with the principles of sustainability. Requirements include proposal, progress report, and a final report containing recommendations for part two of the project, GENE 401. [Offered: F]",

Technological studies relating to gender, education, employment, and war will be used as focal points. Material artifacts will form a core element of the course.",

In everything from foods to pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering is entering daily life. The biotechnology revolution will likely have as much of an impact on our lives as the information technology revolution. However, there is a wide and potentially dangerous gap between research and development on the one hand and societal awareness of its impact on the other. This course is intended to help students gain a deeper appreciation for the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will do this through an investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies and society as genetics and the law, foods and the media, and soil remediation and the environment. Consideration will also be given to the role of computing in biotech research and in the human genome project.",
