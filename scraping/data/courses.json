Students will learn how to estimate and interpret dynamic models and how these models affect our ability to do inference.

A key question is whether legal regimes affect the optimality of an equilibrium and succeed in bringing society closer to a welfare maximizing outcome. From another perspective, a relevant question is on the objective or motivation behind the enactment of specific legislation. Recent studies suggest that much legislation is consistent with simple welfare concepts developed by economists. The course focuses on these issues with examples drawn from property, contract, tort, and criminal law.",

In the lectures, students will be taught various learning strategies that they will be able to apply to successfully meet the demands of their other courses. Students will then apply these modelled strategies in their other courses during a weekly application lab. Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of the material through a variety of assignments. The course will include an engineering component.",

    "description": "The course starts by addressing the ill-structured problems and need for computational intelligence methods. It introduces the concepts of heuristics and their use in conjunction with search methods, solving problems using heuristics and metaheuristics, constraints satisfaction. The course also introduces the concepts of cooperation and adaptations and how they are influencing new methods for solving complex problems. The course starts by illustrating how the concepts of cooperation and adaptation are manifested in nature and how such models are inspiring new types of solutions methods. Topics to be covered include: search algorithms, game playing, constraints satisfaction, meta-heuristics, evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence, ant-colony algorithms, particle swarm methods, adaptive and learning algorithms and the use of these algorithms in solving continuous and discrete problems that arise in engineering applications.

    "description": "Introduces novel approaches for computational intelligence based techniques including knowledge-based reasoning, expert systems, fuzzy inferencing and connectionist modeling based on artificial neural networks. The focus is on the use of soft computing approaches to deal effectively with real world complex systems for which their mathematical or physical models are either non-tractable or are difficult to obtain. The main thrust is on designing computationally intelligent systems with human like capabilities in terms of reasoning, learning and adaptation. Tools of computational intelligence could be used in a wide range of engineering applications involving real world problems such as in planning problems, intelligent control, autonomous robotics, speech understanding, pattern analysis, network design, face recognition, communication systems to name a few.

It focuses on the potential role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle from the extraction of raw materials to the production of goods, to the use of those goods and to the management of the resulting wastes. This course will review the environmental issues associated with chemical industries and the roles of engineers to manage these issues. The principles and philosophy of green chemistry will be addressed including pollution prevention in unit operations. The concepts and practices of environmental life cycle analysis and accounting will be addressed in detail, together with the basics of risk assessment, management and communication. [Offered: F]",

This course is intended to help students gain a deeper appreciation for the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will do this through an investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies and society as genetics and the law, foods and the media, and soil remediation and the environment.
